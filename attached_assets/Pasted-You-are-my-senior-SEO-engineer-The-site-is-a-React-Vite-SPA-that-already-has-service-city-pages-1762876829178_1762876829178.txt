You are my senior SEO engineer. The site is a React + Vite SPA that already has service + city pages. Apply the following targeted fixes and verifications. Keep design/content intact; only SEO-safe edits. When done, output: (1) changed files list, (2) first 25 lines of sitemap.xml, (3) counts of internal links from each page type, (4) a short QA report with ✅/⚠️.

1) Meta & Canonical Hygiene

Remove any duplicate <meta name="description"> on every route. Exactly one per page.

Ensure canonical tag renders per route:
https://dfwpristine.com + current pathname (no trailing “/” duplication; no query strings).
Put it in the shared Head component.

Add consistent OG/Twitter defaults in the shared Head: og:type=website, og:site_name=DFW Pristine Power Washing, a default og:image in /public/og-default.jpg, plus twitter:card=summary_large_image. Allow page overrides but ensure at least the fallback exists.

2) Sitemap & Robots (discoverable in SPAs)

Verify robots.txt at /robots.txt includes:

User-agent: *
Allow: /
Sitemap: https://dfwpristine.com/sitemap.xml


Make /sitemap.xml a static build artifact (not CSR-only). Create a small Node script (or Vite plugin) to enumerate routes for:

Home, About, Services index, each service page, Service Areas index, each city page, Contact/Thank-You if present.

Include <lastmod> = build time (ISO).

Ensure the sitemap file actually lands in the deploy output (dist/) so Vercel serves it at /sitemap.xml.

3) Redirects / Canonical Host

In vercel.json, enforce HTTPS + non-www (301). Use valid Vercel syntax:

{
  "redirects": [
    { "source": "http://dfwpristine.com/:path*", "destination": "https://dfwpristine.com/:path*", "permanent": true },
    { "source": "https://www.dfwpristine.com/:path*", "destination": "https://dfwpristine.com/:path*", "permanent": true }
  ]
}


Verify these deploy and don’t create loops.

4) JSON-LD: Scope & Duplication

Homepage: include one LocalBusiness (with NAP, hours, URL, sameAs) and nothing else global.

Service pages: include a Service JSON-LD with "serviceType": "<Service Name>" and "provider": {"@type":"LocalBusiness","name":"DFW Pristine Power Washing","telephone":"(817) 585-6388"}.

City pages: include a Service JSON-LD with "areaServed": {"@type":"Place","name":"<City, TX>"}.

Avoid multiple Organization/LocalBusiness blocks across non-home pages.

5) City Pages → Unique Local Signals

For each city page:

Add a 100–150 word “Local specifics” paragraph (material types, HOA norms, winter algae streaking, driveway rust from irrigation, etc.). Must be unique per city.

Add a project snippet placeholder (1–2 sentences) and ensure image alt reads pressure washing <City, TX> - DFW Pristine Power Washing.

Internally link to 3 priority services and 2 nearby city pages (unique combinations to avoid site-wide duplication).

6) Internal Linking & Nav

Header: ensure Services and Service Areas dropdowns exist and are crawlable (server-rendered links or normal <a> tags, not JS onClick).

From each service page, link to: Service Areas index + 3 city pages.

From each city page, link to: Services index + top 3 services.

Output a small table of link counts per page type after build (just in the report).

7) Images & CWV Guardrails

Add loading="lazy" and decoding="async" to non-hero images; ensure hero images have explicit width/height to prevent CLS.

Create /public/og-default.jpg if missing (≤200KB).

If any image > 300KB, add a TODO note in the QA report listing its path and size.

8) GA4 & GSC (optional hooks)

If VITE_GA4_ID env var exists, inject GA4. Add event for tel: clicks (label = path).

If a GSC HTML tag string is provided, inject once on all pages (no duplicates).

9) GBP Support Assets

Ensure /content/gbp-posts/README.md exists with 5 ready posts and filenames suggestions for city-tagged images (e.g., dfw-pristine-<city-slug>-driveway-cleaning.jpg).

10) Deliverables / Output

Print list of modified/created files.

Print first 25 lines of dist/sitemap.xml.

Print internal link counts (services → cities; cities → services; header/footer totals).

Print a QA checklist with ✅/⚠️ including:

One meta description per page

Canonical host + path confirmed

Sitemap reachable at /sitemap.xml and referenced in robots.txt

JSON-LD present & scoped correctly (no duplicates)

Internal links per page type (numbers)

Redirects working (examples shown)

Largest image files flagged
