You are a senior full-stack dev working on the dfwpristine.com website (DFW Pristine Power Washing).
Your job right now is to update location + service area content and keep everything in sync for SEO and Google Business Profile.

Step 1 – Understand the project

Scan the repo and tell me briefly:

What framework it uses (likely Next.js/React)

Which files control:

The homepage content

Service area / city pages

Global layout (header/footer)

LocalBusiness / Service schema (JSON-LD)

Don’t change anything yet; just identify these files in a short summary.

Step 2 – Update primary business location

Business currently shows as located in Midlothian, but it MUST now show Arlington, TX as the main location everywhere.

Update the code so that:

The primary location in all visible content = Arlington, TX

Midlothian is only mentioned as a service area, not HQ

LocalBusiness schema, address, and any “based in” or “located in” text uses Arlington

If there is a single central address object, update it to Arlington and reuse that everywhere.

Step 3 – Clean up and align service areas

We have two levels of service areas:

Top Cities (priority for rankings & homepage section)
Use this exact list and order:

Arlington

Mansfield

Dallas

Fort Worth

Plano

Southlake

Grapevine

Carrollton

Midlothian

Waxahachie

Burleson

Extended Service Area List (can appear on Service Area page or map section):

Hurst

Euless

Frisco

Irving

Keller

Addison

Bedford

Burleson

Arlington

Grapevine

Mansfield

Carrollton

Fort Worth

Midlothian

Grand Prairie

Farmers Branch

Richland Hills

Las Colinas (Irving)

North Richland Hills

Dallas–Fort Worth Metropolitan Area

Tasks:

Find the “service area map” / cities list component and:

Replace the city list with the Extended Service Area List above.

Make sure formatting is clean and not duplicated elsewhere.

If there are individual city pages, ensure their titles/meta/headings reference the right city names and link back to the main services.

Step 4 – Add “Top Cities We Serve” section to homepage

On the homepage, add a new section called “Top Cities We Serve” (or similar) that:

Uses the Top Cities list from Step 3.1.

Is SEO friendly (each city name should be wrapped in a link if a dedicated city page exists; if not, link to the main Service Area page).

Keeps existing styling conventions (same typography, spacing, and responsive behavior as other sections).

Place this section logically near the service area/map or just above the footer.

Step 5 – Update schema / SEO alignment

Ensure any LocalBusiness or Service JSON-LD uses:

Arlington, TX as the primary location

A serviceArea or areaServed list that includes the Top Cities (at minimum).

Check <title>, meta description, and any OpenGraph tags on key pages so they no longer claim Midlothian as HQ.

Step 6 – Clean up, check, and summarize

Run whatever build/check commands are standard for this project (e.g., npm run lint, npm run build) and fix any issues you caused.

Give me a concise summary of:

All files you changed

A quick before/after of the main copy changes

Any TODOs you think we should handle later (e.g., missing city pages you recommend adding).

Make all edits now according to this prompt.
