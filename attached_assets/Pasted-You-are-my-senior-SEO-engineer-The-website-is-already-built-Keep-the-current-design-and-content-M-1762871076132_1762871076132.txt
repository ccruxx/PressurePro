You are my senior SEO engineer. The website is already built. Keep the current design and content. Make only SEO-safe, additive edits and create new pages/assets as specified. When choices are needed, pick the simplest, framework-native approach. When done, output a diff/commit list and a short QA checklist.

0) DETECT STACK & ROUTING

Detect if the repo is Next.js / Astro / Hugo / Jekyll / plain HTML.

If Next.js/Astro: use their layout / Head components.

If static HTML: create reusable partials (/partials/head.html, /partials/footer.html) and inject via a tiny build step if one exists; otherwise duplicate minimal head tags per page.

1) CORE TECHNICAL SEO (mirror what we did for rochelle-associates.com)

Create/update:

robots.txt at the site root:

User-agent: *
Allow: /
Sitemap: {{SITE_URL}}/sitemap.xml


sitemap.xml: auto-generate all pages, service pages, every city page, lastmod = current date.

If Next.js: build a /pages/sitemap.xml.ts or API route.

If static: create /scripts/build_sitemap.(js|ts) that scans /pages or /public.

Canonical URLs: add <link rel="canonical" href="{{SITE_URL}}{{current_path}}"> to all pages via the site layout/head.

www/non-www + http→https: if Netlify/Vercel present, add redirects:

Netlify _redirects:

http://*  https://:splat  301!
https://www.dfwpristine.com/*  https://dfwpristine.com/:splat  301


Or Vercel vercel.json equivalent.

Open Graph & Twitter cards defaults with brand image.

2) HEAD TAGS (title/meta rules)

Implement dynamic title/meta rules via layout or per page:

Homepage title: Pressure Washing in {{PRIMARY_CITY}} & DFW | {{BUSINESS_NAME}}

Homepage meta: Benefit-driven, include a couple of nearby towns.

Service pages title: {{Service}} in DFW ({{PRIMARY_CITY}}) | {{BUSINESS_NAME}}

City pages title: Pressure Washing in {{City}} | {{BUSINESS_NAME}}

Add meta description 150–160 chars that mentions service + city.

3) JSON-LD SCHEMA (inject via one partial)

Create /partials/schema.json (or framework equivalent) and include on all pages:

Organization + LocalBusiness with NAP, HOURS, sameAs (Facebook/Instagram if available).

Service blocks for PRIMARY_SERVICES.

BreadcrumbList for service & city pages.

On city pages, include a Service with "areaServed": {"@type":"Place","name":"{{City}}"}.

4) SERVICE PAGES (if not already present, create or improve)

For each item in PRIMARY_SERVICES create/enhance a page under /services/{slug}:

H1: {{Service}} in DFW

Sections: What we do (soft-wash where relevant), Before/After, Pricing note (“free quote”), CTA block with PHONE.

Internal links: link to related services and service-areas page.

5) SERVICE AREAS SYSTEM

Create:

/service-areas/index page listing all SERVICE_AREA_CITIES, grouped South/East/West (simple list is fine), with a short intro paragraph for local relevance.

City landing pages at /service-areas/{city-slug} for each city in SERVICE_AREA_CITIES:

H1: Pressure Washing in {{City}}

Intro: 80–120 words referencing common local jobs/neighborhood types (driveways, HOA standards, stone, clay brick, black algae, etc.).

“Popular services in {{City}}” (bulleted list linking to service pages).

1 local proof element slot: “Recent project in {{City}}” (placeholder image + caption).

FAQ (3 Q&As focused on city concerns).

CTA with PHONE.

Add city-specific JSON-LD Service as noted in §3.

Alt text pattern for images: pressure washing {{City}} - {{BUSINESS_NAME}}.

6) HOMEPAGE + FOOTER UPDATES (lightweight, non-design)

Add a short “Proudly serving” band with inline links to 6–8 top towns.

Footer: NAP block (Name, Phone, Hours) + compact embedded Google Map for the primary city.

Add Review snippet section (copy 2–3 short reviews; no star markup unless compliant with Google’s self-serving review policy).

7) INTERNAL LINKING

From every service page, link to the Service Areas index and 2–3 nearest city pages.

From every city page, link to top 2–3 services.

Ensure the header nav has Services and Service Areas.

8) IMAGES & CORE WEB VITALS

Losslessly compress all images (keep visual quality).

Add width/height, loading="lazy", and decoding="async".

Rename any hero/gallery filenames to semantic variants like:
dfw-pristine-pressure-washing-{{city-slug}}-01.jpg

Ensure CLS-safe placeholders or explicit sizes on hero images.

9) ANALYTICS & GSC (optional but supported)

If GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID provided, add GA4 tag via framework-native snippet.

If GSC_HTML_TAG provided, add it to <head> on all pages.

10) GBP ALIGNMENT (content only, no API)

Create /content/gbp-posts/README.md with 5 prewritten GBP post drafts, each referencing a different town.

Add a /seo/keywords.csv with seed terms:

pressure washing {{City}}, house washing {{City}}, roof cleaning {{City}}, etc. for each city.

11) E-E-A-T BASICS

Create /about enhancements: owner name, years in business, equipment/insurance mention, service guarantees.

Add a simple “Safety & Methods” section (soft-wash for siding/roofs, surface pressure for concrete).

12) TRACKING GOALS

Add click-to-call tel: links; if GA4 present, mark them as conversion events.

If a form exists, ensure a distinct thank-you URL; add to sitemap.

13) REDIRECTS & 404

If any old slugs exist, preserve via 301s in _redirects or framework router.

Make sure /404 exists and links users back to Services and Service Areas.

14) DELIVERABLES

When finished:

Print a file/route list you created/edited.

Print a sample of one generated city page (path + first 20 lines).

Print the first 30 lines of sitemap.xml.

Provide a QA checklist: canonical tags, robots, sitemap ping URL, CLS/LCP notes, internal link counts, and “next posts to write.”

Summarize exact commits/diffs.

15) CONTENT TEMPLATES
A) City Page Markdown/HTML Template (use for each city)
