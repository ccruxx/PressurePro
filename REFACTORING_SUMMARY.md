The project is now fully prepared for static deployment on Vercel:

1. **Build Process**: `npm run build` creates optimized static files
2. **Static Assets**: All images and media files are properly bundled
3. **No Environment Variables**: No external API keys or secrets needed
4. **Direct Contact**: Phone and email buttons for immediate customer contact
5. **SEO Ready**: All meta tags and OpenGraph tags intact
6. **Responsive**: Mobile-first design maintained

## 🔧 Development Workflow

```bash
# Development server
npx vite

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npx vite preview
```

## 📞 Contact Functionality

The contact system now works via direct methods:
- **Phone Button**: Opens device dialer with (817) 585-6388
- **Email Button**: Opens email client with joshuacllns@yahoo.com
